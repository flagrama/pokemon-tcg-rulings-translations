## Venusaur Poké-Power "Harvest Bounty" + Supporter "Professor Oak's Research"
### Q. On my turn, I attached an Energy to my Active Pokémon with a Venusaur with the Poké-Power "Harvest Bounty" in play. I then used the "Professor Oak's Research" Supporter card and drew an Energy card from the deck. Can I attach another Energy card to that same Pokémon?
No, you cannot. You can use "Harvest Bounty" to attach two Energy cards at once, but you cannot attach one copy at a time.

## Charizard's Poké-Power "Burning Energy" + Tyranitar's Poké-Body "Dark Aura"
### Q. If I use Charizard's Poké-Power "Burning Energy," will the "Darkness" Energy attached to Tyranitar with the Poké-Body "Dark Aura" turn into Darkness energy, or Fire energy?
It will become Fire energy.

## Tyranitar's Poké-Body "Dark Aura" + "Darkness" Energy
### Q. Does the Energy Card that is turned into "Darkness" Energy by Tyranitar's Poké-Body "Dark Aura" have the +10 effect of the Darkness Energy card?
No. The Energy Card turned into "Darkness" Energy by the Poké-Body "Dark Aura" does not have the +10 effect.

## Pokémon Tool "Strength Charm" + Baby Check
### Q. My opponent's Active Pokémon is a Baby Pokémon. When my Active Pokémon with a "Strength Charm" attached uses a move, the coin toss on the Baby Pokémon rule is Tails. In this case, do I still discard the "Strength Charm"?
Yes, it is discarded.

## Technical Machine "Multi Technical Machine 01" + Trainer Cards "Clefairy Doll" (Base Set), "Mysterious Fossil" (Fossil)
### Q. If I attach "Multi Technical Machine 01" to a "Clefairy Doll" (or a "Mysterious Fossil") as my Active Pokémon, can they use the "Parlyzing Gaze" move?
Yes, you can use it.

## Supporter "Professor Elm's Training Method"
### Q. Can I search a Basic Pokémon that evolves from a Baby Pokémon with "Professor Elm's Training Method"?
No, you cannot.

### Q. If I don't have an Evolution card in my deck, do I have to show my opponent the deck?
No, you do not have to show your deck. In that case, tell your opponent that you did not have any Evolution cards.

## Trainer Card "Dual Ball" + Baby Pokémon
### Q. Can I use the "Dual Ball" to bring a Baby Pokémon?
No, you cannot.

## Supporter "Professor Oak's Research"
### Q. If there are no cards to return to the deck, do I still have to shuffle the deck?
Yes, you do.

## Supporter "Pokémon Nurse"
### Q. If I use a Pokémon Nurse on a Pokémon that doesn't have any damage counters on it, will all the Energy Cards attached to it be discarded?
Yes, they are all discarded.

## Trainer "Energy Restore"
### Q. If I have three or more Basic Energy cards in my discard pile, can I put only two cards in my hand even if I get 3 "Heads"?
No, you cannot. When three "Heads" are flipped, you must choose 3 cards. If you only have two cards in your discard pile, you choose two.

## Trainer Card "Warp Point" + Ditto "Transform" (Fossil)
### Q. I have a Ditto with 3 damage counters as my Active Pokémon that has been "Transformed" into an 80 HP Pokémon. If I use Warp Point and my opponent chooses a 30 HP Cleffa from their bench and put it into the Active Pokémon spot first, will my Ditto "Transform" into a 30 HP Cleffa before I can select my own Bench Pokémon?
Yes, it will be knocked out. Since the other player replaces first, Ditto will "faint" when the other player puts Cleffa in the Active Pokémon spot.
